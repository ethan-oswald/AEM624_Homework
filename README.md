1) For calorically perfect air with γ = 1.4, using the normal shock relations, plot the following parameters for upstream Mach numbers (M1) 1 to 20. Assume that the incoming flow’s static pressure and static temperature are P1 = 1 atm, and T1 = 298.15 K, respectively. Note that 1 denotes upstream properties and 2 denotes downstream properties, aft of the shock.
a)	M1 vs M2
b)	M1 vs P2 / P1
c)	M1 vs T2 / T1
d)	M1 vs P02 / P01
e)	M1 vs ρ2 / ρ1
2) For calorically perfect air with γ = 1.4, using the Prandtl-Meyer function and the expansion wave relations, plot the following parameters for turning angles 0° to 120° with 1° increments. Assume that the incoming flow’s static pressure and static temperature are P1 = 1 atm, and T1 = 298.15 K, respectively. Also assume that the incoming Mach number is M1=1. Note that 1 denotes upstream properties and 2 denotes downstream properties, aft of the shock.
a)	Turning angle vs log10(M2)
b)	Turning angle vs log10(P2 / P1)
c)	Turning angle vs log10(T2 / T1)
3) For calorically perfect air with γ = 1.4, using the oblique shock relations, plot the following parameters for upstream Mach numbers (M1) 2 to 50. Assume a constant wedge half angle of θ = 10°. Assume that the incoming flow’s static pressure and static temperature are P1 = 1 atm, and T1 = 298.15 K, respectively. Note that β here is the shock angle. Note that 1 denotes upstream properties and 2 denotes downstream properties, aft of the shock.
a)	M1 vs M2
b)	M1 vs P2 / P1
c)	M1 vs T2 / T1
d)	M1 vs β
e)	M1 vs β / θ
